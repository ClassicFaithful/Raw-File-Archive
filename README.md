.ase files = aseprite's unique format, you will need it to work

.psd files = photoshop files, you can use gimp, photopea, or other tools instead as well

.pdn files = paint.net files, you will need it to work

---

if the file has "recreation" in it, it is not original and has been remade, which is going to be slightly inaccurate to the version in the pack, however it's accurate enough to merit adding it

this repository will be expanded upon every time people post a new raw file of a texture currently in a subdivision of classic faithful

if a texture gets replaced that has a raw file here, it will get replaced. if you want access to the original raw file, you can go through the commit history
